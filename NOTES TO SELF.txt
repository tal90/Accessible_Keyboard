in the 'key' class - consider adding the function - 
'public void onPopulateAccessibilityEvent(AccessibilityEvent event)'
search the vitalness of this func and add if needed..


Don't forget implementing the IKeyInteraction..!! from TweetKeys..!

onCreateInputView - in MainIME - at the end.. i shall maybe initiallize the 'TextTweeter'
as i did in TweetKeys
